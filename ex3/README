Questions

1. Difference between sequential and parallel:
A large difference is shown obviously in the big matrix file, since there
are a lot more factors to calculate than in the small matrix and the parallel
mode calculates the same amount of operators only in a parallel time and not
linear time. Which causes the result to be found in only quarter to the time
it takes the sequential mode to calculate.

A small difference is shown in the small matrix calculation runtime. 
Creating threads for each operation takes more time than just forward calculation.
So when the number of operations is so small, there is no benefit from using
parallel mode.


2. Difference between addition and multiplication.
Multiplication of two matrices takes a lot more calculations than addition of two
matrices. 
Again, we can see that in the large matrix test run since the number of calculations 
performed is much larger than in summation.

In small matrices, where the number of calculations is almost similar (in not alike),
between the two operations, thereâ€™s hardly any difference.
